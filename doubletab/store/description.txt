How to git gud? nobody knows... but you could start by getting proper intel!
Double Tab provides you with a super-set of players stats, some of which are: favorite weapon, kill/death ratio, kills per minute, headshot ratio, win/lose ratio and time played.
<h3>Some technical info</h3>
Double Tab runs automatically when you start CS:GO and updates itself when new data is available. you don't have to do anything, just start a new game (competitive or casual) and when you feel like it, hit the tab key two times in a quick succession and voila, when you finish, hit the tab key again to hide it.
