# overwolf-DoubleTab

Another Overwolf App, this time is wasn't for any particular contest, the idea was to try and make money with it, it had 10000 users per month and it made a total revenue of $3... I couldn't even pay for the server, I dropped the app after that.

## Description

How to git gud? nobody knows... but you could start by getting proper intel!
Double Tab provides you with a super-set of players stats, some of which are: favorite weapon, kill/death ratio, kills per minute, headshot ratio, win/lose ratio and time played.

Double Tab runs automatically when you start CS:GO and updates itself when new data is available. you don't have to do anything, just start a new game (competitive or casual) and when you feel like it, hit the tab key two times in a quick succession and voila, when you finish, hit the tab key again to hide it.
